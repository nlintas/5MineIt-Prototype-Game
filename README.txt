Detailed Description:
    5MineIt is a computer game prototype available for Mac OS X (or newer) and Windows that was created for a game development course as a 2 week endeavour from a small development team. The gameplay has the main character mining towards a large treasure room whilst upgrading their arsenal with the valuables they acquire along the way. We offer a variety of weapons and arsenal to upgrade in the shop. One big level (hence the prototype name) that has hours of exploration that can be done with different arsenal configurations. Don't get too comfortable though because your expedition is of limited time be wary of the time limit.

Aims:
    - Provide an overview of the computer game industry and the computer game impact to society. 
    - Introduce fundamental concepts underlying the development of computer games. 
    - Integrate different concepts from various Computer Science fields (HCI, planning, pattern recognition, image processing, data retrieval, virtual worlds etc) with new game and media related concepts (physical modelling, geometrical computing, etc.)
    - Demonstrate an awareness of the effect of computer games on the wider culture and society.
    - Identify problems and issues concerning the story creation of computer games 
    - Develop a computer game specification and design based on appropriate software engineering principles.
    - Analyze, plan and manage a computer game development project.
    - Successfully develop a computer game, based on a given specification and by utilising appropriate game development technology.

How to run:
 - .exe and DMG versions compatible with Mac OS and Windows with no additional configurations (Tested in Mac OS X and XI, Windows 10 2020 Autumn updates and Spring updates).
 - To run in development mode you need to open the project file from the source code with the Godot game engine (Tested in Godot 3.x.x).
